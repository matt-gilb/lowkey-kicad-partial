# LowKey36 by Matt Gilbert

This is the ZMK source repo for the LowKey36 spit keyboard.

## This is a prototype!

This repo holds the basic KiCAD files I used to create the prototype of the LowKey36 (v1.2), but it doesn't have all the component symbols/footprints included. As a result you will probably get errors trying to open/edit the PCB design.

Once I have the public-ready v2.0 procduced, I will remove this repo to avoid confusion. For now I'm sharing it for those who are curious.

You can find the ZMK files for the LowKey36 [here](https://github.com/matt-gilb/zmk-config-lowkey36.git).
